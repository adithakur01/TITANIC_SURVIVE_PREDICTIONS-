# TITANIC_SURVIVE_PREDICTIONS

This project implements a simple GUI application using Tkinter in Python to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The prediction is made using a Decision Tree Classifier trained on the Titanic dataset.

# Getting Started

To run the application, make sure you have Python installed on your machine. Clone this repository, navigate to the project directory, and execute the following command:

```bash
python your_file_name.py
Replace your_file_name.py with the actual name of your Python script.

User-Friendly GUI: The application provides a straightforward graphical interface for users to input passenger details and obtain survival predictions.

Decision Tree Classifier: The underlying machine learning model utilizes a Decision Tree algorithm for predicting survival.

Data Preprocessing: The script preprocesses the Titanic dataset by handling missing values, converting categorical variables to numerical, and splitting the dataset for training and testing.

Model Evaluation: The training accuracy, testing accuracy, and classification report are displayed to evaluate the performance of the model.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)
pandas
scikit-learn
Install the required dependencies using:

pip install pandas scikit-learn
Usage
Run the script.
Enter passenger details in the GUI (Pclass, Sex, Age, Fare, Embarked).
Click the "Predict Survival" button to obtain the prediction.
